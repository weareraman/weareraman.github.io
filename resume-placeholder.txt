society. I have multi-sectoral, multi-domain expertise and over thirty years of nationwide experience across India, and
globally. Uniquely I have worked across government and non-government bodies, research, academia as well as people’s
movements. My social sector involvement and contributions include co-founding of several important organisations
including some of the noted state-civil society partnerships and spearheading some of the renowned large-scale programs
and campaigns. I have led policy, research, financing and advocacy initiatives, right from grassroots to national and
international levels. I also have senior level involvement with some of the flagship development missions of India, namely,
Swachh Bharat Mission for total sanitation; Jal Jeevan Mission for universal provision of piped water supply; National Health
Mission (both rural/urban) to improve health, health systems and policy; Poshan Abhiyan on Nutrition and National Literacy
Mission on mass education.
Throughout my work, I have prioritised strengthening of social, financial as well as governance accountability mechanisms,
and community level institutions that foster such processes. My associations with the (a) initiatives to prepare Medium
Term Expenditure Framework for Health Sector by the State Government of Chhattisgarh (b) Community based
monitoring processes for health, nutrition, education, employment and food security in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand states

Municipal WASH financing in India and South Asia (g) global Community of Practitioners on Accountability and Social
Action in Health (COPASAH), and (h) Global Health Watch as part of the Peoples Health Movement - all exemplify
these. Added to these, I have also been focussed on rights based inclusion of weaker and marginalised/excluded sections
of society in various policies and programs across sectors. These include work for the rights of women, persons with
disabilities, gender minorities, children, persons engaged in manual scavenging. Systems thinking and addressing
complexities in systems and policies are also areas where I have some critical national as well as global engagements.
Currently I work as the Executive Director of the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), a renowned
Indian think tank. I am also supporting part time the Sanitation Learning Hub, Institute of Development Studies,
University of Sussex, as their India in-country focal person. Till end of May 2023, I was also working as the Senior Policy
and Research Mentor for the Centre for Social and Environmental Innovation at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology
and the Environment, for the REAL-Water Global consortia research on rural drinking water supply. I have previously
worked with organisations such as WaterAid (Head of Policy), Public Health Foundation of India/ Indian Institute of
Public Health (Principal Fellow) and State Health Resource Centre Chhattisgarh (Chief Coordinator and Director).
I am associated with some of the well-known academic and training institutions as well, as invited expert faculty, which
include the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (Applied Health Systems and Financing) , Birla Institute of Technology
and Science Pilani (sanitation financing), Tata Inst of Social Sciences (WASH governance), Indian Inst of Public Health
(health systems and policy; social determinants of health; environmental health), National Inst of Rural Development and

issues of significance, in renowned journals and publications. I have been part of several boards and expert committees
too, that has key roles in shaping some of the critical policies as well as governance accountability systems.
In addition to my formal work engagements, I am volunteering for some of the social causes around health, nutrition, and
WASH, with some of the known people’s movements, including the Public Health Resource Network, India chapter of
the Global Peoples Health Movement called the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, All India Peoples Science Network, Delhi Science
